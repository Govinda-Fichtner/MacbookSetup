# MacbookSetup

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/Govinda-Fichtner/MacbookSetup.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/Govinda-Fichtner/MacbookSetup)

A streamlined, automated setup script for macOS development environments. Get your Mac ready for development in minutes, not hours.

## üöÄ Purpose

Setting up a new Mac for development is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to solve that by providing:

- A single command to install all necessary development tools
- Consistent configuration across different machines
- Reproducible development environments
- Easy onboarding for new team members or after OS reinstalls

## üì¶ What's Included

This setup automates the installation and configuration of:

### Core Tools
- **Homebrew**: Package manager for macOS
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Direnv**: Environment variable management per directory

### Development Environments
- **Ruby** (via rbenv): Ruby version manager with latest stable Ruby
- **Python** (via pyenv): Python version manager with latest stable Python

### Containerization and Infrastructure
- **OrbStack**: Fast Docker & Linux VM manager with Kubernetes support
- **Kubernetes Tools**: kubectl, helm, k9s, kubectx, kustomize
- **Container Utilities**: dive, ctop, buildkit
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Packer
- **System Monitoring**: htop for process monitoring

### Terminal and Editor Tools
- **iTerm2**: Enhanced terminal emulator
- **Warp**: Modern terminal with AI features
- **Zinit**: Z shell plugin manager
- **Starship**: Cross-shell customizable prompt
- **Other tools**: See the Brewfile for the complete list

### Configuration
- Shell environment configuration (.zshrc)
- Tool initialization and setup
- Path configuration

## üîß Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Govinda-Fichtner/MacbookSetup.git
cd MacbookSetup

# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup
./setup.sh
```

### What It Does

1. Checks if Homebrew is installed; installs it if needed
2. Installs all packages from the Brewfile
3. Configures your shell with necessary tool integrations
4. Installs the latest stable Ruby and Python versions
5. Sets up development environments ready to use

### Customization

To customize your setup, modify the `Brewfile` before running the script. Add or remove packages as needed:

```ruby
# Add a formula (CLI tool)
brew "your-package-name"

# Add a cask (GUI application)
cask "your-app-name"
```

## üìã Requirements

- macOS Catalina (10.15) or newer
- Administrative privileges on your Mac
- Internet connection
- For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3): Rosetta 2 is recommended (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`)

## üß™ Continuous Integration

This project uses Cirrus CI to validate the setup script on real macOS environments:

- Every commit is tested on macOS ARM (Apple Silicon) virtual machines
- The setup script is executed in a clean environment
- Installation of tools and configuration is verified

You can view CI build history on the [Cirrus CI dashboard](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/Govinda-Fichtner/MacbookSetup).

### Testing Strategy

The CI pipeline employs a focused testing strategy to efficiently validate the core functionality:

#### What We Test

- **Shell Configuration**: Verifies that `.zshrc` is properly set up with all required tool integrations (rbenv, pyenv, direnv, Starship, etc.)
- **Command-line Tools**: Tests the installation and availability of essential CLI tools that form the backbone of the development environment
- **Environment Initialization**: Ensures that version managers and shell extensions initialize correctly

#### Testing Approach

The CI testing differentiates between several types of components:

1. **Essential CLI Tools** (fully tested):
   - Tools like Git, rbenv, pyenv, direnv, and Starship
   - These are verified to be installed, available in PATH, and properly configured
   - They represent the core functionality needed for development

2. **GUI Applications** (not tested in CI):
   - Applications like iTerm2, Warp, and Visual Studio Code
   - These are skipped during CI testing as they:
     - Cannot be meaningfully tested in a headless environment
     - Take longer to install and consume more resources
     - Don't affect the functionality of other development tools

3. **Optional Utilities** (not tested in CI):
   - Additional command-line utilities that enhance the development experience
   - While valuable for users, they're not essential for validating the setup process

This targeted testing approach ensures that:
- CI runs remain efficient (typically under 15 minutes)
- Core functionality is thoroughly validated
- The setup script's reliability is maintained

When you run the setup script on your actual machine, it will install all tools including GUI applications and optional utilities as specified in the Brewfile.
