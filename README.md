### Testing Strategy

The CI pipeline employs a focused testing strategy to efficiently validate the core functionality:

#### What We Test

- **Shell Configuration**: Verifies that `.zshrc` is properly set up with all required tool integrations (rbenv, pyenv, direnv, Starship, etc.)
- **Command-line Tools**: Tests the installation and availability of essential CLI tools that form the backbone of the development environment
- **Environment Initialization**: Ensures that version managers and shell extensions initialize correctly
- **Shell Completions**: Validates that command-line completions are properly configured for all installed tools

#### Shell Completion Testing

The setup includes a comprehensive completion testing framework that verifies:

1. **Multiple Completion Types**:
   - Zinit plugin completions (e.g., Terraform)
   - Built-in Zsh completions (e.g., Git)
   - Custom completions (e.g., rbenv, pyenv, kubectl)

2. **Tested Tools**:
   - Core Development: Git, rbenv, pyenv, direnv
   - Infrastructure: Terraform, Packer
   - Kubernetes: kubectl, helm, kubectx
   - Shell Enhancements: Starship

3. **Verification Process**:
   - Checks if completion plugins are properly installed
   - Validates that completion functions are loaded
   - Tests basic completion functionality for common commands
   - Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Structured configuration for adding new tool completions
   - Support for different completion mechanisms
   - Easy integration of new completion tests

This completion testing ensures that developers have full access to command-line completions, improving productivity and reducing errors.
