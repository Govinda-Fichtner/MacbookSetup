# MacbookSetup

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/yourusername/MacbookSetup.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/yourusername/MacbookSetup)

A streamlined, automated setup script for macOS development environments. Get your Mac ready for development in minutes, not hours.

## üöÄ Purpose

Setting up a new Mac for development is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to solve that by providing:

- A single command to install all necessary development tools
- Consistent configuration across different machines
- Reproducible development environments
- Easy onboarding for new team members or after OS reinstalls

## üì¶ What's Included

This setup automates the installation and configuration of:

### Core Tools
- **Homebrew**: Package manager for macOS
- **Git**: Version control system
- **Direnv**: Environment variable management per directory

### Development Environments
- **Ruby** (via rbenv): Ruby version manager with latest stable Ruby
- **Python** (via pyenv): Python version manager with latest stable Python

### Terminal and Editor Tools
- **iTerm2**: Enhanced terminal emulator
- **Warp**: Modern terminal with AI features
- **Zinit**: Z shell plugin manager
- **Other tools**: See the Brewfile for the complete list

### Configuration
- Shell environment configuration (.zshrc)
- Tool initialization and setup
- Path configuration

## üîß Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MacbookSetup.git
cd MacbookSetup

# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup
./setup.sh
```

### What It Does

1. Checks if Homebrew is installed; installs it if needed
2. Installs all packages from the Brewfile
3. Configures your shell with necessary tool integrations
4. Installs the latest stable Ruby and Python versions
5. Sets up development environments ready to use

### Customization

To customize your setup, modify the `Brewfile` before running the script. Add or remove packages as needed:

```ruby
# Add a formula (CLI tool)
brew "your-package-name"

# Add a cask (GUI application)
cask "your-app-name"
```

## üìã Requirements

- macOS Catalina (10.15) or newer
- Administrative privileges on your Mac
- Internet connection
- For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3): Rosetta 2 is recommended (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`)

## üß™ Continuous Integration

This project uses Cirrus CI to validate the setup script on real macOS environments:

- Every commit is tested on macOS ARM (Apple Silicon) virtual machines
- The setup script is executed in a clean environment
- Installation of tools and configuration is verified
